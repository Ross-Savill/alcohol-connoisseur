## Project

Drink And Rate, a MERN app where you can record scores you give to your beverages to share and display with others.

Various pages outlay data relating to drinks, drinkers, ratings (a score out of 10 and two descriptive words), companies and their countries of origin. Various methods are used to display the data including tables, charts of various types, country/global maps and a word cloud.

Further information relating to the data of both the front-end and back-end of this app can be found in their respective folder's README files.

To gain a copy of the app you can fork a copy to your repo and run react and node together by using "npm start" in both folders.

## Project Status

Currently in development. The various pages are at varying stages of completion with regards to information displayed and design. Drinks are currently uploaded to the Mongo database via MongoImport and an "Add Drink" and "Add Drinker" process are to be completed.

## Ongoing Reflection

I began design on this app during the early stages of the government's Covid lockdown as a way to maintain and develop my skills using Javascript alongside React, Express, Node and MongoDB.

I've managed to gain a good grasp on React Hooks having previously mainly stuck to React Classes and lifecycle methods to construct applications. This is also the first application I've built where I've used Auth0 to manage site entry.

I'm in the process of learning more and more about data manipulation and visualization, having created multiple tables and charts to display the information relating to over 2500 beverages. Each drink can have up to six different mixers with varying degrees of information. I'm still in the process of establishing different ways of storing and displaying this data.
